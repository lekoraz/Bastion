Bastion aims to be a highly performant and complete World of Warcraft data visualization layer, as such developers may
leverage it to create combat rotations, gathering bots, quest bots, and much more!

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged, however I do ask that scripts such as rotations live in their own repository, 
for the moment the included restoration druid rotation is the exception as it serves as a learning resource for developers
to reference in creating their own scripts. 

Feel free to browse around the [Wiki](https://git.tinkr.site/4n0n/bastion/wiki) or just start by reading the code!

## Quick Start
- [Download](https://git.tinkr.site/4n0n/bastion/archive/main.zip) or clone the repository. 
- Move the bastion folder to your `Tinkr/scripts` folder. 
- Once in-game type `/bastion toggle` to enable the engine.
